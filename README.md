# Shoppe-Image-Classification


Hello! This is an assessment of the Shoppe e-commerce [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching). Shopee is an e-commerce company located in Southeast Asia, Brazil, Mexico and Taiwan. The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that would effectively match similar products based on their text titles and images. The company is known for its â€œLowest Price Guaranteed'' for the products listed on its [website](https://shopee.com/). Having an effective model that can group similar products should be helpful in finding the best price for consumers. In order to assist in optimizing the Shopee algorithm, A convolution neural network (CNN) and Tf-Idf + Cosine Similiarity were developed to match products based on their respective images and texts. Then a Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier model was introduced to stack the models in a final result.
